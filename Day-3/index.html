The classic yet edgy jewelry pieces are minimal and versatile and can often be worn in different ways, a reflection of the designer’s personality and lifestyle.</p>

                    <p align="justify"> Kellie was <em>motivated to start her own brand</em> to offer individuals a way to express their true essence, designing pieces for both men and women. All of the brand’s pieces are an extension of its DNA - strength, individuality and authenticity.</p>
